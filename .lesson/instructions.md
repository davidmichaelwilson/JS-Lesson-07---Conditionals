# Instructions  

**Practice 1:**

Check if the oxygen outside Mars Base Alpha is safe for breathing.
Log an appropriate message to the console if it is or isn't.

let oxygen = 50

> - if less than 50 -> "You can't breathe outside right now. Danger!"
> - else            -> "It's safe to breathe."

*This time there's no `else if`, so think about it a bit.*

**Practice 2**

In 2274 when you turn 30 years old you must go to the Carrousel where you hit the end of the line - as in ignomious death. If you don’t show up, the Sandmen track you down. A crystal in your palm will flash when it’s your time to go to the Carrousel.

Check if a person must go to the Carrousel.
> - if less than 30 -> "Live another day."
> - else if exactly 29 -> "Your crystal is flashing. You have one year left."
> - else if exactly 30 -> "It's time for the Carrousel!"
> - else -> "The Sandmen are chasing you."

**Practice 3**

Without running the code, write after the // if the expression evaluates to true or false. Then run the code and check your answer.
```
console.log(4 === 3)  // 
console.log(5 > 2)    // 
console.log(12 > 12)  //
console.log(3 < 0)    //
console.log(3 >= 3)   // 
console.log(11 <= 11) //
console.log(3 <= 2)   //
```
